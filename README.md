#Software vs Data

This repostory is intended to be used to discuss and document the difference between software and data in the context of citation.

It has been created in the process of writing the FORCE11 Software Citation Principles and then submitting them to PeerJ Computer Science and responding to reviewer comments.

We start with the idea that software, while similar to data in terms of not traditionally having been cited in publications, is also different than data.

Software can be considered a type of data, but the converse is not generally true. 

The remainder of this document gives examples of these differences.

If you want to add a new difference, please do via a pull request.  Similarly, if you want to add a citation or add new explanation, please also do this via a pull request.  If you want to discuss a difference (for example, you don't think it's correct), please open a new issue or discuss via an existing issue.

##List of Differences
###Software can be used to express or explain concepts, unlike data.

Explanation?

Evidence: Citations?

###Software is updated more frequently that papers or data.

Datasets can of course be frequently updated, but each update likely represents the findings of a new or repeated study.

More explanation?

Evidence: Citations?

###Software is executable, unlike papers or data.

Explanation?

Evidence: Citations?

###Software suffers from a different type of bit rot than data.

Software must be constantly maintained so that it continues to function as both the hardware and software environments that it is used on changes, as developers find and fix bugs, and as user requirements demand new features and capabilities.  On the other hand, bit rot for data is generally thought of as the underlying hardware that holds the bits changing, or software that can interpret the data also needing to be updated.  These types of bit rot also affect software&mdash;the software is actually stored as a set of bits, and these bits must be interpretted, often as ASCII or UNICODE characters&mdash;but software bit rot is generally thought of as a concern of a higher level on top of this.

Evidence: Citations?

###Software is frequently built to use other software, leading to complex dependencies, and these dependent software packages also frequently change.

Explanation?

Evidence: Citations?

###Software is generally smaller than data, so a number of the storage and preservation constraints on data don’t apply to software.

Explanation?

Evidence: Citations?

###Software teams can be large and multidisciplinary, and with varied roles that overlap and sometimes make contributions ambiguous—some of which can rise to a level equivalent to paper authorship.

Explanation?

Evidence: Citations?

###The lifetime of software is generally not as long as that of data.

Explanation?

Evidence: Citations?
